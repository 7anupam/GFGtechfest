            <h2>Ergonomics for Office Workers</h2>
            <p>Proper ergonomics in your workspace can greatly reduce physical strain and discomfort. Here are some tips to optimize your desk setup:</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>1. Desk and Chair Setup</h3>
                <img src="desk and chair.png" alt="Desk Setup">
                <p>Ensure that your desk and chair are adjusted to fit your body. Your chair should support your lower back, and your desk should be at a height where your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.</p>

                <img src="monitor position.png" alt="Monitor Position">
                <p>Your monitor should be at eye level to avoid straining your neck. The top of the screen should be about eye level and the screen should be about an arm's length away from you.</p>
